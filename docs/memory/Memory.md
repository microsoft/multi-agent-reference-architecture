# Memory

TBD

<!-- - Memory: `Short-term` memory stores temporary data relevant to ongoing tasks, -->
<!--   such as session-specific details or intermediate results, and is typically -->
<!--   used by agents during active operations. `Long-term` memory allows agents to -->
<!--   store and recall information across sessions, enabling more personalized and -->
<!--   intelligent behavior over time (commonly implemented using databases, -->
<!--   knowledge graphs, or vector embeddings). In a travel planning system, for -->
<!--   example, long-term memory might store a user's preferred airlines, past -->
<!--   destinations, loyalty program details, or hotel preferences. This historical -->
<!--   knowledge allows agents to make smarter recommendations—like suggesting a -->
<!--   hotel chain the user frequently books or prioritizing flights that align with -->
<!--   their travel habits—much like a personalized assistant that improves with -->
<!--   every interaction. -->

<!-- Memory can be structured in different ways: shared memory between the orchestrator and specialized agents allows for synchronized access to common information, facilitating coordinated responses. Alternatively, individual agent memory ensures each specialized agent maintains its own context and knowledge, which is useful when agents work independently or have domain-specific expertise. In scenarios like personalized travel planning, shared memory may store user preferences across different agents, while individual agents may retain specific task-related knowledge (e.g., a flight agent remembers the last search criteria, while a hotel agent stores room availability data). -->
