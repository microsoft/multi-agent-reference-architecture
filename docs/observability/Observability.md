# Observability

As AI solutions evolve into complex, distributed systems—especially when
leveraging multi-agent architectures—observability becomes essential to ensure
reliability, performance, and trust. Observability is the capability to
understand the internal state of a system based solely on its external outputs.
This is not just about identifying when something breaks, but understanding why.

Observability is built on three core pillars:

- Logs: Discrete events and contextual information about what the system is
  doing.
- Metrics: Numerical data points that provide insight into system health and
  usage.
- Traces: End-to-end visibility into the flow of a request across services or
  agents.

Together, these form the telemetry data needed to assess system behavior in real
time. Unlike traditional debugging, observability enables proactive monitoring
and faster incident response, which is critical for enterprise-grade AI systems.
