# Security
_Last updated: 2025-05-12_

This document outlines the security considerations and best practices for
implementing multi-agent systems in enterprise environments. The architecture
prioritizes responsible AI usage, data protection, access control, and
observability at every layer.

## Core Security Principles

### Identity Enforcement

- Agents and orchestrators authenticate via Azure AD or equivalent identity
  providers.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) governs agent execution and orchestration
  permissions.
- Ensure mutual authentication between agents using enterprise identity systems
  (Entra ID, SPIFFE, etc.).
- Use X.509 certificates or JWTs signed by an internal CA to verify agent
  provenance.
- Support rotating credentials for long-lived agents.

### Scoped Agent Capabilities

- Agent registry enforces capability declarations and metadata tagging.
- Only approved capabilities can be executed in runtime.

### Data Governance & Storage Policies

- All storage layers (state, conversation history, registry) support
  encryption-at-rest.
- Retention policies are configurable per agent or orchestrator.

### Secure Communication

- All communication between agents, orchestrator, and external tools is
  encrypted via HTTPS or mutual TLS.
- MCP protocol supports signed payloads and call tracing.

### Policy-Controlled Tool Invocation

- MCP server validates tool access policies before invocation.
- Integration layer enforces audit logging for all tool calls.

### Memory Management and Redaction

- Short-term memory is scoped to current conversation thread.
- Long-term memory undergoes PII redaction and consent-based storage.

### LLM Usage & Guardrails

- Prompt templates include safety instructions.
- Responses are filtered by safety classifiers and optionally passed through
  moderation APIs.

### Auditability and Observability

- Every orchestration and agent call is logged with metadata: timestamp, caller
  identity, input hash, output hash.
- Logs are shipped to centralized observability platform (e.g., Azure Monitor or
  OpenTelemetry).

### Adversarial Testing & Red Teaming

- Simulate attacks (prompt injection, message corruption, impersonation).
- Use chaos security engineering to validate robustness of inter-agent
  communication.

### Agent Versioning and Rollback Strategy

- Version every agentâ€™s logic, prompt configuration, and communication contract
  (e.g., using SemVer).
- Support graceful coexistence of multiple versions (e.g., v1 agents in
  production, v2 agents in testing).
- Use feature flags or routing rules to selectively enable agent versions per
  customer or region.
- Always enable immediate rollback to a previous version if anomalies are
  detected (e.g., via GitOps or CI/CD workflows).

### Business Continuity and User Safety

- Establish SLOs for agent performance (latency, availability, decision
  quality).
- Define user impact metrics before deployment (e.g., error rate, abandonment
  rate, CSAT).
- Automate runtime health checks and user experience monitoring tied to release
  gates.
- Include manual override mechanisms (e.g., pause/disable an agent class)
  without affecting the overall system.

## Enterprise Data Protection in RAG Scenario

### Document Indexing Layer

When indexing documents, ensure to include sensitivity and/or permissions
(owner, edittable, etc) information in included as a retrivable field.

### Retrival Layer

When retriving/vector search for documents, filter on relevant sensitivity or
permissions based on agent or user role or identity

### Agent (using RAG) Layer

Before generating response from the resulting document, ensure the retrieved
documents are viewable by the user as another layer of protection

### Indentity Layer

Ensure that the user identity has roles or permissions associated and the
identity is secured by following the "Identity Enforcement" section of this
guide

## Compliance Considerations

- Support for GDPR/CCPA consent flows.
- Optional on-premise deployment for sensitive workloads.
- Integration with enterprise data loss prevention (DLP) systems.

## Future Additions

- Integration with confidential computing enclaves (TEE).
- Fine-grained token scopes for agents.
- Agent-level anomaly detection models.
