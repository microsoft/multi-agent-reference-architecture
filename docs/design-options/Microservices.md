# Agents as Microservices
_Last updated: 2025-05-16_

In the microservices design, each component—such as the orchestrator and every
specialized agent—is encapsulated as an independent service running within its
own process, potentially on separate machines or cloud services. These agents
interact exclusively via well-defined APIs or messaging protocols. This
distributed approach is a natural fit for complex multi-agent systems where the
demands for scalability, maintainability, flexible technology stacks, and
deployment autonomy outweigh the operational overhead of distributed systems.

## Key Characteristics

- **Service Independence**: Each agent is developed, deployed, and scaled
  independently. Teams may choose distinct languages, frameworks, or even cloud
  platforms for each service.
- **Technology Flexibility**: Microservices enable teams to choose the most
  appropriate technologies for each service, rather than being constrained to a
  single tech stack. This allows agents developed by different teams—or even
  entirely separate organizations—to interoperate seamlessly. The architecture
  enables rapid innovation and the integration of specialized solutions tailored
  to the specific needs of each service.
- **Distributed Infrastructure**: Each service manages its own infrastructure
  resources (memory, storage, replicas), yet they collaborate through network
  communication (e.g. REST, gRPC, message queues).
- **Decentralized Governance**: Policy enforcement, agent governance, and
  versioning are implemented via inter-service contracts and registration
  protocols rather than assumed by process boundaries alone.
- **Observability across services**: Logs, traces, and metrics must be
  correlated across process and service boundaries for effective troubleshooting
  and monitoring.

## Trade-Offs

### Advantages

- **Scalability & Resilience**: Each agent or workflow component can be scaled
  independently, reducing the impact of failures and enabling cost-efficient
  scaling tailored to each workload.
- **Deployment Autonomy**: Teams can deploy updates to each agent without
  redeploying the entire system, enabling continuous delivery and faster
  iteration cycles.
- **Bounded Contexts**: Agents encapsulate their own logic, state, and
  dependencies, reducing unintentional coupling and easing long-term codebase
  evolution.
- **Technology Diversity**: Teams can explore and adopt a variety of tools,
  language and libraries for each agent—freeing teams from monolithic technology
  decisions.

### Disadvantages

- **Operational Overhead**: There is significant complexity in managing,
  monitoring, and securing distributed services (service discovery, API
  gateways, network policies, etc.).
- **Increased Latency**: Inter-agent communication occurs over the network,
  introducing latency and potential failure modes compared to in-process calls
  from monolithic services.
- **Consistency and State Sharing**: Sharing memory or context across agents is
  nontrivial and may require specialized infrastructure (e.g., distributed
  caches, messaging system, etc).
- **Complex Governance & Security**: Security policies must be enforced at
  network and application levels; clear agent registration and health-check
  protocols must be established to avoid ambiguity and reduce attack surface.

## Layered Patterns Within Microservices

While orchestrator and specialized agents are physically separated into their
own services, the **Onion (Layered) Architecture** can still be implemented
_within each service_. This practice enforces internal discipline, clear
separation of responsibilities, and maintainability:

- **API Layer** — Exposes network endpoints (REST, gRPC, etc.) for agent
  operations.
- **Service Layer** — Implements the agent's core business logic (task
  delegation, reasoning, workflow, etc.).
- **AI Layer** — Connects to language models, RAG pipelines, or other AI
  infrastructure, abstracting external dependencies.
- **Knowledge Layer** — Handles integration with vector databases, contextual
  knowledge stores, file systems, or external data sources.
- **Persistence Layer** — Manages local or distributed storage, caching, and
  transaction boundaries as needed by the agent.
- **Integration Layer** — Connects to external APIs, services, or third-party
  platforms as needed for agent tasks.

Within each service, these layers interact via internal contracts—mirroring the
clean boundaries needed for future maintainability.

## When Is a Microservices Approach Best?

Many successful systems begin as modular monoliths and evolve by gradually
extracting agents or the orchestrator into services as scale, team size, or
business requirements change. This staged approach helps avoid costly
over-engineering early on, while preserving the option to scale, diversify, and
federate component ownership later.

Consider starting with microservices in the following situations:

- For mature multi-agent systems operating at significant scale, or with
  non-uniform workload patterns requiring independent scaling or cost
  optimization.
- In organizations with multiple teams, or those desiring to onboard/exchange
  third-party agents built in divergent technology stacks.
- For scenarios where team autonomy, deployment velocity, and continuous
  evolution of individual agents or workflows are top priorities.
- When strong, observable governance and authentication boundaries between
  agents are required (e.g., regulated or sensitive domains, or when hosting
  agents from external parties).

**Recommended practices:**

- Design agents with explicit APIs and versioning from the start.
- **Adopt service discovery and registration mechanisms** to identify which
  agents are available at runtime and to ensure orchestrator-to-agent
  compatibility.
- **Enforce strict network boundaries:** Control agents communication from the
  networing perspective (e.g. specialized agents only communicating with the
  orchestrator, not directly with each other). This provides clear workflow
  governance, traceability, and better security.
- **Implement robust observability:** Use distributed tracing standards (e.g.,
  OpenTelemetry) and log correlation mechanisms to maintain visibility across
  the system.
- **Plan for graceful failures** and fallback strategies, as network partitions,
  agent unavailability, and other distributed failure modes are inevitable.
