# Versioning Strategies

_Last updated: 2025-09-25_


Versioning Strategies:
Versioning agentic AI agents requires more than tagging releases with a version number.  It requires a thoughtful approach to managing behavioral evolution, memory and orchestration logic.  The items below are strategies that organizations can adopt to ensure safe, traceable and scalable agent versioning.

 - **Immutable Agents**: Freezing agents at deployment for auditability and rollback.  This strategy has you treat each deployed agent as immutable.  Once released it cannot be altered.  This guarantees that behavior can be traced and reproduced as it occurred and works in environments where regulatory or compliance is required with the ability for reproducibility and auditability.

 - **Semantic Versioning for Agents**: Applying major/minor/patch logic to behavioral and architectural changes.  This provides a consistent framework to communicate the scope and impact of any changes.  It also allows consumers of the agent to understand the scope and impact of any changes as they incorporate the agent into their solution.  This provides the ability to track compatibility of agents with tools and their versions as well as track each version to a risk level, test coverage and known limitations.  This meta data should be stored in an agent registry and linked to the deployment pipeline.

 - **Forking and Branching**: Create forks of agents for experimentation, A/B testing or domain specific adaptations.  This enables experimentation and parallel development of agent variants without disrupting production agents.  The forking strategy provides an additional benefit of splitting agent usage for different customer segments or business units such as V1.1 enterprise and V1.1 retail.

 - **Shadow Agents**: This strategy has you deploy a new agent version in a shadow mode alongside productions agent in order to observe the new agent versionâ€™s behavior without affecting any outcomes.  This reduces risks by validating changes in a live environment and running the new versions in parallel for A/B testing and safety validation.

 - **Rollback Protocols**: Create a process to revert to a known-good state if the new version introduces a regression or compliance issue.  This is designed for graceful degradation and recovery for continuity in business-critical solutions.
