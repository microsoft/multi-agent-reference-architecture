# Agent Versioning

_Last updated: 2025-09-24_

As artificial intelligence continues its rapid evolution, a new process has unfolded.  The software development lifecycle has been modified to consist of **experiment and build, evaluate and test, adapt, transition to the deployment environment, continue to test, version and repeat**.  The repeat part requires us to think about how do we version Agentic AI Agents?


Traditional software versioning strategies, anchored in static codebases and predictable release cycles, fall short when applied to agentic systems.  These agents may learn from experience, update their internal models, or even reconfigure their tool chains in response to dynamic goals.  Their behavior is shaped not only by code but by memory, context, and interaction history.  As a result, versioning an agent is no longer just about tracking code changes.  Itâ€™s about capturing the evolution of behavior, intent, and capability.  An AI implementation strategy is no longer optional but essential for organizations and the most critical component of this strategy is a comprehensive approach to agent versioning and rollback capabilities.  These systems act as safety nets, allowing organizations to quickly revert to stable versions when new deployments cause unforeseen issues.

These sections will explore the emerging discipline of agent versioning: how to define, manage, and govern the lifecycle of AI agents.
