# Agent Versioning

_Last updated: 2025-09-24_

As artificial intelligence continues its rapid evolution, a new process has
unfolded. The software development lifecycle now includes **experiment and
build, evaluate and test, adapt, transition to the deployment environment,
continue to test, version and repeat**. The repeat portion forces us to answer a
crucial question: how do we version agentic AI agents?

Traditional software versioning strategies, anchored in static codebases and
predictable release cycles, fall short when applied to agentic systems. These
agents may learn from experience, update their internal models or reconfigure
their toolchains in response to dynamic goals. Their behavior is shaped not only
by code but by memory, context and interaction history. As a result, versioning
an agent is no longer just about tracking code changes. It is about capturing
the evolution of behavior, intent and capability. An AI implementation strategy
is no longer optional but essential for organizations, and the most critical
component of that strategy is a comprehensive approach to agent versioning and
rollback capabilities. These systems act as safety nets, allowing organizations
to revert quickly to stable versions when new deployments cause unforeseen
issues.

These sections explore the emerging discipline of agent versioning—how to
define, manage and govern the lifecycle of AI agents.
