# Agent Versioning Maturity Model

_Last updated: 2025-09-24_


Every organization will adapt as they continue to implement Agentic AI and the versioning practices will evolve through distinct stages of maturity.  This model will help you assess where you customers are today and what capabilities are needed next to ensure safe, scalable and purpose-built agent lifecycle management.



| **Level**           | **Stage** | **Characteristics**               | **Risks**          | **Next Steps**                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**   | **Ad-Hoc**      | Agents are deployed without formal versioning.  Updates are manual and commonly undocumented.    | High risk of regressions, compliance gaps, and lack of traceability.                         | Establish basic versioning policies and agent registries.              |
| **2**      | **Scripted**           | Versioning is partially automated via scripts or through manual tagging.               | Limited rollback capability and inconsistent metadata.                        | Introduce semantic versioning and behavioral snapshots.                                                |
| **3**       | **Managed**                             | CI/CD pipelines support agent versioning.  Metadata, memory, and dependencies tracked. | Improved reliability, but limited support for behavioral drift or orchestration.       | Integrate observability and governance guardrails. |
| **4**         | **Autonomous Governance**  | Agents participate in their own lifecycle management (e.g., self-versioning proposals).   | Requires robust oversight to prevent unintended evolution.      | Implement policy engines, human-in-the-loop controls, and risk-aware routing.        |





As you use this model, assess your current practices across agent types and business units.  Align versioning maturity with the criticality and autonomy of each agent.  Advance through the model incrementally by investing in tooling, governance and cross-functional collaboration.  Also realize that you may not need to get to the highest level in all your agentic solutions.  Different teams and implementations may adhere to different levels of maturity, and you may decide going beyond level 3 doesnâ€™t provide the business value.  Therefore, getting to a level where agentic solutions need to have agents participating in their own lifecycle management may be reserved for select teams or implementations.

In following the maturity model, guidance and practices consistently, your AI agents will move from "usually works" to "never breaks".  When regressions occur, you'll instantly know where, why, and how to fix them with one-click rollbacks ready and waiting.
