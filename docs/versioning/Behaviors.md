# Agent Versioning Behaviors

_Last updated: 2025-09-24_

**What makes agent versioning different**

To start with, we need to understand what makes agent versioning different. Versioning in traditional software (and machine learning systems) is predominantly deterministic. It is anchored in static codebases and predictable release cycles. Agentic AI, by contrast, introduces a new level of complexity. These agents are not just executing instructions; they are reasoning, adapting and evolving in response to dynamic environments. This shift requires a rethinking of how we define and manage versions. We need to be thinking about and planning for the following:

**Agent behavior**

Agentic agents’ behavior is affected through the model used and its version, the prompt and system context, and tool availability through model context protocol (MCP) calls. This introduces variability, and new versions may be required when developers continue to tweak the prompts for optimal responses. It is essential that, when versioning agents, you are comparing multiple versions side by side, ensuring a comparison to a measured baseline. 

**Stateful and contextual behavior**

Agentic AI agents often maintain memory across interactions, enabling them to build context, learn user preferences and refine strategies over time. This state means that versioning must account for code and model changes as well as memory snapshots and contextual embeddings. A new version may behave differently, not because of a code change, but because of accumulated experience. It is important to remember that AI systems are non-deterministic, and the outputs can vary even with the same prompts.

**Autonomy and self-modification**

Unlike static models, agentic systems may modify their own behavior through reflection, planning or tool selection. This introduces the possibility of agents evolving independently of their original design. Versioning must capture not just what the agent was built to do, but what it has become through interaction. We also need to capture version changes to tool calls through MCP endpoints, as well as functions called from the function calling capabilities of the model.

**Tool and API dependencies**

Agentic agents often rely on external tools, APIs or plugins to complete tasks. These dependencies may change independently of the agent itself, which will create versioning challenges around compatibility, observability and rollback. A minor API update could significantly alter an agent’s behavior, even if the agent’s core logic remains unchanged.

**Multi-agent coordination**

In many enterprise scenarios, agents do not operate in isolation. Multi-agent systems collaborate, delegate and orchestrate tasks across a network of other agents. Versioning in this context must account for inter-agent dependencies and inter-agent communication, ensuring that updates to one agent do not break the behavior of the collective group of agents. We need to be thinking about whether all the agents for the solution are getting updated as a group or individually. We also need to consider which team in the organization owns the agents, if they are being shared across the enterprise. Will the new version of the shared agent interfere with other systems calling those agents?


**Behavioral drift and emergence**

Because agentic systems are non-deterministic and adaptive, their behavior can drift over time. This makes it difficult to define a “version” purely in terms of code or configuration. Instead, versioning must include behavioral baselines, test trajectories and performance metrics that reflect how the agent behaves in everyday activities. You need to include automated tests for evaluations, performance and comparison to baselines to identify any drift.
